# agbemu

A mostly complete and somewhat accurate Game Boy Advance Emulator. Supports all the graphics subsystem except for mosaic and all of audio except for wave ram banking. Passes many test roms including ARMWrestler, JSMolka's gba-tests, and a sizable portion of the mGBA test suite including all of the memory tests and almost all timing tests that do not require the prefetcher. It runs all games I have tested without any issue.
