# agbemu

A mostly complete and somewhat accurate Game Boy Advance Emulator. Supports almost all of the graphics and audio subsystems. Passes many test roms including ARMWrestler, JSMolka's gba-tests, and a sizable portion of the mGBA test suite including all of the memory tests and almost all timing tests that do not require the prefetcher. It runs all games I have tested without any issue.
