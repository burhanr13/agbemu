# agbemu

A Game Boy Advance Emulator. Currently the CPU, Graphics and most internal components are done with minor exceptions. Games I have tested work very well. Also reasonably accurate and passes a nontrivial amount of test ROMs. Games that require EEPROM will not work as that is currently unimplemented. Also no audio, mosaic, or serial yet.
